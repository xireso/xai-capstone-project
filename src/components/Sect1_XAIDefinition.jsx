        <h3>XAI Definition</h3>
        <p>
          Given an audience, an explainable Artificial Intelligence is one that
          produces details or reasons to make its functioning clear or easy to
          understand.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my opinion, it is crucial that the definition of XAI refers to the
          concept of audience, as the cognitive skills and goal of the users
          have to be taken into account along with the with the
          understandability of the model.
